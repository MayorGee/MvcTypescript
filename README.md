# Task Description
   
 **_Using MVC pattern, make a site that can be used to interact with a given database_**


# Introduction
  This project was built on the NodeJs version 16.13.2 and fully written in ES6. As much as I could, I tried to obey the SOLID principles, so the code is reuseable for similar problems and can easily be dissected into smaller parts should the need arise. The following npm packages were used :

  * body-parser: ^1.20.0,
  * dotenv: ^16.0.2,
  * express: ^4.18.1,
  * http-proxy-middleware: ^2.0.6
  * browser-sync: ^2.27.10,
  * del: ^7.0.0,
  * gulp: ^4.0.2,
  * gulp-autoprefixer: ^8.0.0,
  * gulp-concat: ^2.6.1,
  * gulp-csso: ^4.0.1,
  * gulp-file-include: ^2.3.0,
  * gulp-htmlmin: ^5.0.1,
  * gulp-nodemon: ^2.5.0,
  * gulp-sass: ^5.1.0,
  * liquidjs: ^9.42.0,
  * mysql-await: ^2.2.2,
  * node-sass: ^7.0.1,
